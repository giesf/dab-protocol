## Vision & Motivation
The internet we use daily has been taken hostage by for-profit cooperations that don't have their customers best interest at heart.

This has lead to advertisement bombardment, addicting products and mental health issues.
We are not able to compete with the sheer amount of data, brain power and computing power these cooperations have accumulated and have become their victims.

Since it is not possible for us to change their products (disable the instagram reels feature) we need to create alternative products.

## Monetization
Here monetization is key, if we follow the same business strategy as existing cooperations we end up becoming the very thing we try to destroy.
Our strategy should be to create open source software and finance the development by providing for profit hosting.
This allows everyone to have a say in the development in the softare or fork it in case they want to change it, but still allows us to pay our costs.

## Sooo... What do we want to build?
We want to build something that helps us stay connected with our friends in this world where we live so vastly different lives and in different geolocations.
We make friends when traveling, move to a different city or just struggle to keep in touch with all our aquiantances. 
At the same time we want to express ourselves: share experiences we make, art we create and lessons we learn.

## Well thats already out there!
Sure, there are projects such as:
- Mastodon
- Diaspora
- Friendica
But they don't excell in user experience and have a high barrier of entry.
A typical problem amongst open source projects.

## Team & Collaboration
In order to allow for collaboration, everything decision needs to be documented inside this public git repository.
When ever we talk about this project in person / privately we need to make sure we document in here.
Language should always be English, code of conduct, etc. You know the drill already.
